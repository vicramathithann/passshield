# Password Strength Checker (Python)

A simple and lightweight **Password Strength Checker** written in **Python**.  
It checks your passwordâ€™s strength based on **length**, **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **special characters** â€” and also **suggests a stronger password** if needed.

This version uses **visible input** (you can see what you type).  
Tested and works perfectly on **Kali Linux** and other Linux systems with Python 3.
